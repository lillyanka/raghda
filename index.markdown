# how you can help Raghda's family

In order to receive financial assistance, Raghda's friends have set up a [campaign](https://gofund.me/a47ed4bfc) so you can help her and her children continue to resist through the genocide.

# Raghda's story

Raghda is a 25 year old young mother of two: Tia who is 3 and Anas who just turned 1 years old not long ago.

Raghda has completed her studies in Sports Education and was running an activities club for displaced children up until several months ago when she was displaced once again to Khan Younis.

With her husband being displaced in another part of Gaza and family funds coming to an end, Raghda faced yet another set of problems and decided to take the matter in her own hands by making videos showcasing her struggles of having to look after two small children, all under heavy daily bombardment, shelling, famine, irrespective of whether it was hot or cold, day or night.

For any parent out there, we all know how difficult is to raise a child, let alone two, without any suport system in place or a job.

Raghda hopes, with your help, to raise sufficient funds to move to Egypt and hopefully start a new life, when the border reopens. 

Please read Raghda’s story, in her own words:

> I am Raghda, 25 years old, a mother of two— Tia and Anas. My son was just one month old when the war broke out. While other mothers rocked their babies to sleep in warm homes, I was shielding mine from bombs. While parents worried about milestones, first words, and sleepless nights, I worried about whether my children would live to see another day.
> 
> Before the war, I had dreams. I was studying to become a sports trainer, eager to help others grow strong, to build a healthier future for my community. But war doesn’t just take lives—it takes dreams, futures, everything you thought was possible. Now, my only goal is survival. For over a year, I have been alone, displaced again and again, separated from my husband, carrying the weight of two small children with no home, no security, no help. I have been a single mother in the worst way possible—not by choice, but by war.
>
> The world thinks we are lucky to have survived. But survival is not living. Aid is being blocked, and each day, the struggle grows harder. Mothers are forced to watch their children starve, their tiny hands reaching for food that isn’t there. In peaceful countries, single mothers face challenges—but they have shelter, schools, support. Here, we have nothing but fear, hunger, and the unbearable reality of an uncertain future.
>
> I am reaching out to anyone who understands that health and peace are not luxuries—they are necessities. You may be a parent, a student, an athlete, a person who believes in hope. Ask yourself: How can young people build their future when they are denied even the basics of life? How can a mother raise her children when the world turns away?
>
> I wanted to train others to be strong. Now, I am left wondering if I will ever be strong enough to survive this.
>
> This is not just my story—it is the story of thousands of mothers and children who are barely holding on. But you can help. Share our story. Speak up. Support humanitarian aid. Because no mother should have to beg for her child’s survival. No child should suffer just for existing.
>
> Do not look away. Do not let silence be the answer. Because silence, for us, is a death sentence.
>
> With gratitude,
> Raghda
